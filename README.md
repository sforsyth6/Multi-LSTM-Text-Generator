# Multi-LSTM-Text-Generator
*In progress* A text generator which implements Long Short Term Memory RNN units to achieve autonomous sentence generation. The current approach uses an embedding space of 25,000 words that was trained using a skip-gram model to better understand the semantic relationship between the words.
